# Applied Data Science Capstone

Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate â€“ SpaceX Falcon 9 landing prediction using API, web scraping, EDA, ML, and dashboards.

This project was created as part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science) and [Applied Data Science Capstone course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) on Coursera.

## Overview

You will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX. The main goal is to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land.

The project includes:
- Data collection from SpaceX API and web scraping
- Data wrangling and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash and Folium
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
